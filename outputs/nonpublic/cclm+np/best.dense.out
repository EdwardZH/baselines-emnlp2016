The Secret of Genetic Testing for
What is genetic risk ?
Genetic risk refers to the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
People get sick because of the changes .
The genetic change shows the chance of developing the disorder is not always clear .
If your genetic results indicate that gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease .
The opposite is also true .
If your genetic results show that you do not change associated with an increased risk of heart disease , it is still possible to develop heart disease .
However for some rare diseases , people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease .
When we are diagnosed with out certain genetic disease , are we suppose to disclose the results to our relatives ?
My answer is no .
On the one hand , we do not want a potential danger causing firghtenning affects our families later .
When we know that we have a certain disease , their attitudes will be easily changed , whether caring for us or keep away from us .
And that  is not what we want , most of us just want to live as normal people .
Surrounded by such concerns , it is very likely that we are distracted to worry about these problems .
It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life , because we never know when the ''potential bomb " will explode .
On the other hand , there are ways to help control or cure the disease , we can go through these processes from the scope of the whole family .
For example , exercising is helpful for potential disease , we can always look for opportunities for them to exercise .
And we keep track of family health .
At the same time , we are prepared to know other members have this disease .
I want to share Forest'view on this issue .
Some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington 's disease has an ethical obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings , there is no legal requirement to do so .
In fact , requiring people to communicate their own genetic risk to family members who are therefore at risk is considered to be ethically dubious .
"
Nothing is absolutely right or wrong .
If a certain disease genetic test is accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and know it is OK to disclose the result .
Above all , life is a secret .
Genetic risk does have its consequences and should not be taken lightly within the family circle .
Afterall , what affects a family may or may not affect other , although families have a genetic make up , shared by both parents .
In cases where an individual has gotten to know a genetic disorder , disclosing otherwise his or her relatives is just a matter of preference the indivdial morals . 
The issue to know or not to know is highly debatable , although it is a genetic risk , not entirely because genetic information could result from the families of both parents , his maternal and paternal uncles , aunts and cousins .
This also means that when a person is aware of his or her genetic profile , concurrently with knowledge .
This maybe relavant , and vice versa .
An example that may serve as an illustration of breast cancer .
It is hereditary .
One who suffered from this disease , keep it a secret to inform their relatives ?
In retrospect , it is one to ensure that he or she will undergo periodic healthchecks on their own .
Sometimes family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication .
Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered by the son or daughter , the parents who know this will decide who gets told and who takes precedence being 'allowed ' .
For example , in a family , regardless of who had received genetic information , they were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to children , adults at risk .
In addition , women testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than herself , although this may be further complicated by an individual 's response to risk information as they want .
Hence , there were tensions if participants felt that they could not pass on to relatives who needed to know ( nieces and nephews ) and persuade those with authority ( parents ) .
The notion of authority also extended 'vertically .
For example , a grandmother may have the authority to pass than an aunt , even when she is not at the genetic risk while the aunt .
From a practitioner 's perspective , these findings are important because if lay constructs of family and kinship are a social construction may not be in line with geneticists ' views of family relationships , or about blood or non-blood ) relatives should be informed and by whom ; this is likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context .
Ultimately , one must bring attention to who may benefit from such information and assisting at risk to make considered decisions about disclosure .
Whose duty is to inform at risk relatives greatly depend on the personal moral nature of 'directive the risk is .
People with close blood relationship generally have similar genes .
In this case , if one of the family members or close relatives are found to have genetic risk , it is better for the patient to tell his or her relatives about the issue and let others know about the risk and his or her family members are able to perform daily excesses to prevent potential disease or go to the hospital and checked the correspongding flows .
In my opinion the annouance of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of personal privacy , the carrier is obligated to tell to his or her relatives in order to prevent potential disease .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .
Focus on the negative side of annouance of genetic risk .
Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk to keep it a secret as the genetic risk may indicate their chance to certain diseases .
Especially for the young people marry , if they are known to have a genetic risk , there may be a chance that a child will carry the disease , but not certain .
Therefore , the secret to their future spouce would help the relationship .
Second annouance the potential risk would cause the family to be aware of this particular issue , although the factor is not serious , people still fear that they will have some potential problems in the future and go to the hospital and another check or take medicine to prevent the disease , and this creates unnecessary costs .
The annouance genetic risk affects the relationship with the relatives as sometimes others do n't stay too close to the carrier , so they have less chance for potential disease .
On the other hand , if the genetic risk is kept as a secret , although it may help the carrier to a certain extent and the privacy , but it has a much larger negative impact on the family members and relatives .
In the case of marriage , people should be honest and tell his/her spouce may carry certain genetic risks that may affect their offspring .
It is better to let the other party know after the baby is born with a certain type of genetic disease is found .
It is better for both parties to be honest .
Secondly , genetic disease has a close relationship with the children with their daily habits .
For example , if a carrier is told that he/she has the risk of diabetes .
In this case , the carrier can eat less candies and chocolates to prevent intake too much sugar , and if the carrier tell this information to the relatives , it will be useful for them to know that they have diabetes in the future because of related genes and they can perform the same exercise to consume less sugar to prevent the disease .
Otherwise , if the other party did not know , they may end up having diabetes in the future without prevention .
In conclusion , the benefits of using genetic risk to the carriers relatives overweights costs .
Therefore , the carrier is obligated to inform the relatives to let them know and prevent potential disease through daily exercises .
Among all kinds of diseases , a large amount of different kinds of disorders are caused by genetic factors .
Genetic disorder may or may not be hirataged hereditary disease and it is sometimes hard to find one of these kinds of diseases .
It is a long discussion on whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives , his or her disease is caused by gene .
From a legal perspective , the answer is no , but the ethical aspect , the answer should be yes .
We ca n't make a law to push a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his relatives about his genetic problem .
It is immoral and impractical .
Firstly , having the disease is his or her privacy .
Privicy protection belongs to human rights .
If a law requires someone to tell others their privacy , especially when they are not willing to do so .
It is against their human rights and the law 's spirit .
The law 's spirit to fairness .
What is the basic difference between a genetic disorder and disorders .
It is unfair to impose a law point to the genetic disorder .
In addition , it is impractical to make such a law .
The law should be clear and easy to understand .
However , there are many problems against the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her relatives becau se of their diseases .
Firstly , what is the range of relatives ?
For example , the carrier to tell his or her direct relatives , parents and brothers and sisters , he needs to tell relatives on his grandmother 's sister 's son 's daughter 's nephew ?
If you need to direct relatives , the fairness of law .
Relatives may have the same opportunities to have this kind of disease .
How can a law made by the government except a group of people preparing to face their potential disease ?
However , from the ethical point of view .
The carrier himself or herself , he or she should feel resposiblity to tell his or her relatives genetic disorder .
By doing this ,they will be able to save the lives of their relatives .
It is a career with children may not necessarily have a genetic disease if they coresponding healthy lifestyle before a gene function becomes stronger .
A typical example is genetic caused hypertension .
Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make the carrier harder to digest the fat and salt in the blood , which can cause hypertension .
People usually get this hypertesion after they become adults .
However , if they know they have a gene that makes them more possibilities to hypertention .
They can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat and thus prevent hypertension .
In a nutshell , our society ca n push the problem carrier to tell his disease to his or her relatives , but they should be willing to tell their relatives about their genetic problem .
By doing so , less of his or her loved ones will suffer from the genetic problem .
In the age of rapid technological advancement , medical breakthroughs are possible .
Genetic testing is made possible for their decision to undergo .
It is able to detect the illnesses or diseases and even a child 's parentage .
However , it is a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives .
If the genetic risk to be shared with family or relatives , there might be a chance for them to have it in their blood , which they may do necessary precautions to prevent .
If it is a terminal disease as a genetic disease , relatives will be disheartened by the knowledge .
Therefore , they will have the idea of keeping it a secret .
This essay will discuss whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives .
Some people say that the genetic risk is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as personal information should be kept confidential .
Most patients get depressed after realizing his or her condition .
If one has a genetic disease after the test , he or she might wish to inform the relatives as he might end up dishearten his extended family .
Some will wish to keep it to themselves and to ensure that they will not bring any pessimism in their family .
Furthermore , some will wish to become a burden on anyone as seeking medical attention is costly .
Hence , it is considered in the genetic risk of getting the disease confidential .
On the other hand , others think that it will be considerate to tell the relatives because they will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk .
Hence , they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to take measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease .
Nevertheless , it depends on what kind of genetic diseases in the context of medical technology .
For example , breast cancer is a genetic disease that can be cured if it is made in the early stages .
Hence , the knowledge of genetic risk , the relatives of the genetic disease will have a medical check-up , which might help them to realize it earlier .
In conclusion , it would be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives .
Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention , such as financial issues , everyone should be given the right to know their family inherited medical conditions .
However , it might be better for those who are ignorant and will continue to lead a happy life .
In addition , some may think that knowing about the genetic risk of the disease , adding on to the misery as there is nothing we can do about it .
All-in-all , it depends on the nature of the disease , he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities in treating or preventing it .
Genectic testing is a personal decision with the knowledge that there is a possibility that one could be a carrier .
Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing , even if there is no risk .
Early pre-examination healthy will cast away unwanted doubts and affect the psychological thoughts of those who are affected .
A genetic risk carrier , there should be choices given with regards to inform his/her relatives .
It should not be forced or obligied , as negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier .
With regard to this choice , there must be some rules to regulate the exercise of personal freedom of decision making .
If the genetic risk carrier is a minor child , then most likely the decision of informing the relatives should be made with consideration of the patient 's parents or legal guardian .
These patients are still very volatile , or they may be unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorders due to their age .
Furthermore , the act of telling others without consent from their parents or patients could harm the psychological state of the affected family .
Thus , I decided to put on the immediate family as caused a stir of unwanted events from the patient and family members .
Some families may feel hurt with regards to their family pride or reputation , the knowledge of genetic disorder in their family .
However , there is a role and responsibility to inform their relatives as it is a genetic disorder .
There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder can affect their relatives and other families within the same family tree .
The importance of informing relatives of the genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention of genetic disorders .
This information will help their relatives to make informed decisions tosimilarly undergo genetic testingto find the outcome .
Thus , the knowledge that genetic disorder is benign benefits towards their an emotional thoughts .
If it turns out to be otherwise , then the family can prepare emotionally and psychologically for the future outcome and help them in making the decisions .
In addition , the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is made known to them .
Having support from relatives are vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness and will provide a morale booster for the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards to the future prospects of the genetic disorder which can be inherited by anyone in the family .
Therefore , the decision to inform relatives of the genetic disorder is dependent on the background of the effect , with the freedom of choice for them to make the decision of informing .
The disorder , regardless of mental or physical disorder , always be aware of his or her family .
When it comes to genetic issues , it is not that simple .
Genetic disorder inheritance is for generations , but not all of them show some symptoms .
Sometimes a potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm in their bodies as their members reflects a observable disorder symptoms .
As a result , when one of the members might feel uncomfortable or unusual , he or she should be aware of the disorder in their body is a genetic risk .
Afterwards , the carrier will face a serious ethical issue , which is to reveal the problem to his or her relatives .
If the disorder symptoms reflect a kid , the parent will be informed by the medicine , then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies ' .
On the contrary , if the carrier is an adult who has his own choice to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk , that will be more complex .
One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his family more than himself , there is no doubt that he will tell his family about the issue .
That is true , and it is the obligation of the family to protect and take care of the family .
On the other hand , if a child in the family has a chance to become a genetic risk carrier and risk should inherit his child , his life will be in a dilemma .
And of course , he or she will not have a child after getting married , the same thing goes to the cousins .
As a result , the generation stops with the adult carrier announces the issue .
In China , the older generation with traditional backgrounds will always have more children and grandchildren , the liven up .
The reason is that after WOWII the population of China has decreased dramatically and the government encourages people to give birth .
During that period , the family reflects genetic disorder symptoms will fall into an ethical dilemma .
The medical technology that is not advanced enough to cure him .
He chose to protect his family and his family prosperity with a potential generic risk .
And so , he chose not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be mined .
The ethical issue can not be judged by others because they will not understand the position and the duty of the carrier in the family .
In conclusion , people should think carefully about the consequences of telling relatives the generic disorder .
It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives , but also an obligation for a family to encourage the family .
Regardlessly , if the disorder is rarely fatal , it does not cause any inconvenience to the carrier , revealing the truth is the right thing to do .
In my opinion , the carrier should tell his or her relatives .
One of the reasons why a carrier , he or she needs a mental support to go through .
It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue .
By telling his or her family as a support could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now .
I believe that a strong bond with our family is the biggest pillar of support for the carrier .
Furthermore , a genetic problem , it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family as the family might experience .
By making sure that they are aware of the problem , they could have a good time and it would be better if they could prevent it from happening to them .
It is important to tell if it is contagious , the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading .
For every action there is always pros and cons .
I believe that the carriers will choose to reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want their family to worry and feel uncomfortable or even ostracized .
Furthermore , it could incur spending a lot of money for the treatment , the carrier might not want to be a burden to her family .
I could understand the feeling of the carrier .
He does not want to be the source of unhappiness in thefamily .
However , we will never know whether these negative effects will happen when the carrier decided to tell his family about his or her condition .
In conclusion , I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform family members about the issue .
The carrier should be honest with their feelings and it is the right of the family to know what is going on in his or her life .
If anything happened to the carrier , without informing the family members could be a huge regret in life if she leaves without knowing it .
On top of that , it is better to think about solutions for problems with the family members as there are heads to think rather than thinking and struggling on your own .
In the end , I believe that the support of mental and monetary from your family could help the carrier to fight against genetic disease .
True enough , there are lots of cancer patient who was given the choice to live as a normal person as a mental support from their loved ones .
In my opinion , as long as we keep our minds healthy and strong , we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak .
As the technology has advanced , it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers ethical dilemmas related to acutual use of technology .
Genetic testing has made possible- it becomes easy to tell a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing .
If used for a good purpose , it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness , it could make the situation worse by revealing the carrier in the family .
The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives , the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I believe that they have the right to know .
Firstly , genetic testing is not something that is compulsory .
Of course , some people may use it to make their futures slightly happier , however , the carrier , the testing can choose not to go back and live with strangers and accept the facts .
If he chooses to live in the uncertainty of the gene holds and willing to accept it , he could do it something 'normal ' in past gentic testing was not possible .
It would be better for him .
Some people might say that it is a form of prevention of giving birth to disabled people and making them suffer in real life .
I personally think this ist he true purpose of the genetic testing , families who can not afford to have a disabled child do not have to give birth to their child and the entire family suffer .
However , I believe that the carrier has the right not to tell anyone but has a responsibility to take action to prevent any ethical dilemma .
The result was that the carrier can not accept that it would have been better off not knowing the truth .
I believe that carriers have the right to know the truth .
After realizing that he or she is she carrier , the emotional damage will be hard to bear .
It could possibly cause a problem in the family due to the fact that creates more unhappiness in the family .
Overall , I believe that it all depends on the carrier to share the facts and the relatives , but he has no obligation to tell .
In fact , I think that the carrier should discuss both the positive and negative consequences of genetic testing and take appropriate results .
The emotional depression that the carrier might get the sense of guilt can be expected and could be a burden for the rest of your life .
On the other hand , without knowing any genetic disorder and accepting the family will stay positive and work together to overcome diability .
I think the family will stay mentally healthy , without emotional stress .
Debates have been around for years , a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to inform his or her relatives .
Any individual at risk for a disorder has to undergo genetic testing , whether the results should be told to others , especially close family or relatives is a topic that is worth discussing .
This is an issue that needs to be addressed as family-related ethical dilemma is involved .
In this essay , arguments will be pointed out in support of any carriers of known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives .
When we were born , we were surrounded by our family and relatives to welcome to this new world .
We were crying but we are not alone , our family and relatives grow up .
Hence , the people will be grateful for the people we would like to share the joy .
However , in relation to health issues , to the extent of serious disorder , there is no point of sharing but this involves more than just sharing bad news .
One has the right to disclose his or her health , but it 's also a responsibility to inform the family and close relatives .
As the health issue is related to genetic risk , with a focus on genetic , which highlights the risk of passing the disorder to the next generation .
Therefore , I agree that it 's required for a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives to avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could be improved in the future .
Although one may argue that it 's up to individuals to disclose health issues to bear within themselves , it 's certainly helpful to share with close relatives , the discussion for solutions .
By doing so , it will be less stressful in facing such disorder risks .
Relatives will be supportive and show more caring towards the carrier of a known genetic risk .
By informing them , the carrier is not alone in fighting the battle of disorder risk .
On top of that , the genetic risk may pass down to the next generation , it will involve more than one family .
It is therefore I support the obligation of telling the relatives of both parties when one is about to get married and have a plan for giving birth .
This would prevent the rise of family-related ethical dilemma .
There are many intangible advantages that support the stand of informing the relatives once the results are known after the test conducted .
In conclusion , in order to avoid the family-related ethical dilemma , it is best for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his/her relatives .
The benefits of doing so will outweigh its disadvantages .
More support will be provided through various means to give better direction when standing of junction should to inform the relatives .
The decision to undergo genetic testing can only be made by the individual at risk for a disorder .
This is the common law in the society .
However , it leads to a new problem that a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
This issue has been discussed for a long time .
However , there is a diversity of views among the people .
Thus , to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue " should or should not .
Firstly , I believe most of us will agree with the sentence : " I am anxious about my family when he told me that he was a carrier of a known genetic risk .
Frequently , the intention of the families do not want to tell their families to continue their lives without the fear of their families .
It is obvious that it is better for people to be worried about that .
However , many of the families are not strong enough to overcome the challenges .
With family support , there will be more energy to fight the demon .
Demon is not easily defeated and it requires a lot of energy and psychological support .
Families have the courage and support that you have .
That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges .
Besides , the risk of known genetic is so serious that it can not be described .
The seriousness can be larger than our imagination .
Lying on the bed for the life and death , the consequences of which we can not imagine .
Families are our dearest .
Without their concern and support , it is hard to stay .
They play an important role in our lives , which can not be substituted .
A known genetic risk can affect our next generation critically .
Therefore , it is our responsibility to tell the relatives to prevent the occurrence of undesirable consequences .
Generally , the clinic or hospital will not tell the carrier 's family without the consent of the carrier .
It is the ethic of the staff in the secrets of patients .
We ca n't blame them because they are prone to undesirable consequences .
However , the hospital can provide a councilor to advise the carrier of the action can be taken .
Therefore , this kind of situation will happen again and again .
It is a process that benefits both parties , a win-win situation .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk is encouraged to tell his or her relatives about the known genetic risk .
However , there may be something that is hard to be defined .
Thus , the advice from the hospital plays an important role .
The Carrier is responsible to pay his or her own interests and the benefits of family and society .
It is a hard decision to make the most appropriate way , it will create great conditions for the carrier and families .
The risk of genetic disorder , many individuals have made the decision to undergo genetic testing .
The nature of the results will be known once the tests are done , each individual is diagnosed with a genetic risk carrier an ethical problem to warn their relatives about the risks of the same genetic risk carrier .
Or they can choose to keep silent until the carrier is diagnosed .
In my point of view , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives to support .
First of all , from the point of view of human rights , the genetic risk carrier should not be obligated to tell the truth .
This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privacy for carriers .
They do not want this because they want to keep it a secret and not others .
This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of a carrier may be discriminated against or sympothized by not positive factors to their life .
Secondly , the relatives of the carrier can also choose to genetic testing than dignosis of the carrier .
When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers , they can approach a doctor to consult .
If they do not want to think too much and see it as a problem , they may ignore the possibility .
However , if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives , the relatives will be forced to know their chance of genetic risk carriers .
This obeys their willingness as they have to accept the truth which may make their life miserable .
Many people argue that setting the obligation may help more people who are relatives of carriers , save their lives with a better chance of early diagnosis .
However , this is not true when other factors including psychological influence , social influence , are taken into consideration .
If one relative said that he or she may have a higher risk of getting sick , he or she may be scared about the unknown , partners , spouses and colleagues may choose to leave , and many other situations may happen the family 's life may be ruined .
On the other hand , as stated above , people want to know and prepare the result can choose the genetic testing .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk should have the right to decide whether to tell their relatives .
This should be accepted by the human rights , freedom of acceptance of relatives as well as many other social reasons .
Otherwise , it is an obligation to restric the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives .
A carrier of a genetic disorder to know that he or she is a carrier , it can cause more problems than the disorder .
I agree that a carrier of a known genetic risk is obligated to tell his or her relatives .
There are four reasons why people do n't be shy and share their problems regarding genetic disorders .
Firstly , the carrier and his or her family can take precautions , work on measures to reduce the chance of it being inherited by children and mentally if it fails to prevent it from being inherited .
Many syndromes such as Down Syndrome and Taylor Syndrome can be prevented and if the mother took the medication and do n't consume harmful things during pregnancy .
This information may not be known by the mother if she told her relatives about her condition .
People ( relatives ) know , more channels are provided .
If all efforts have been made , but they still suffer from the syndrome and the family have to accept this and do whatever they can to bring a good environment for their children .
This is not the parent 's fault because there is still a chance of the gene being inherited .
So , they have to prepare mentally .
Secondly , genetic diseases is high for treatment and medication .
Albinism is one of the examples .
People with albinism have sensitive skin and need regular treatment .
Unlike people with a high proportion of skin pigment , people with albinism are prone to sunburn and other skin diseases .
If they do n't treat their bodies , such as using sunglasses and wear sunscreen outdoors , chances are good that they will get skin problems that may lead to cancer .
Once you suffer from cancer , the medication is very expensive .
To prevent the biggest problem , it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body .
If the carrier does not tell his or her relatives , it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially .
Thirdly , some diseases are noticeable and may lead to serious health problems .
One of the diseases is sickle cell trait .
Most people are not aware that they carry the sickle cell gene , which may lead to circulatory problems such as blood blocking .
If they know that a career and disclose the information to their relatives so that they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and do n't be shy because it is for the sake of their children 's health .
Finally , it is important for parents to give emotional support for children with genetic disorders .
When children become teenagers , a lot of social problems that may arise .
People and friends value of your condition .
A strong mind and conviction must be built from within the closest .
If their family , who else is willing to do that ?
It is not a difficult job for the family if they prepare themselves mentally by giving the probability that their children will suffer from the genetic disorder .
In this modern world , the technology has improved a lot in the last century .
Particularly in the medical field , improved treatments for formally incurable diseases , genetic testing is one of the methods used to diagnose individuals at risk for genetic disorders .
Medical authorities claim that individuals who are at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing .
However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known , a family-related ethical dilemma .
The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives .
This is because his or her relatives have the right to know .
As many people know , a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier 's relatives , the family members are at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members have the same risk , so this problem should be treated seriously .
Every family has the right to know what is going on .
If they do not know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder , can explain ?
For instance , John is told by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder , but he does not tell his siblings , James .
Although telling James that is horrible to some extent , he should know what is likely to happen .
This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder .
The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of similar genetic disorder , prevent certain genetic disorders to affect .
Genetic disorders are innate , but the improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or reduce the negative effects of the disorder on their own .
In addition , doctors usually quote the statement " Prevention is better than curation " which gives us that preventing disorder for far more advantages than fixing it .
Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for , therefore , the prevention of a certain disorder .
For example , hypertension is partially due to genetic factors , environmental factors also play an important role .
People who are aware of having such disorder can prevent the disorder to happen by adopting a healthy lifestyle , a balanced diet and exercising for 30 minutes every day .
To sum up , a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
This is the human right to know , and also save their lives by preventing the disorder .
With the advancement of technology over the past decades,medical advancement has increased exponentially and enhancements are constantly upgrading.Empower doctors with advanced medical knowledge,doctors are able to diagnose and undergo genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their life.However , once a test has been conducted and the results are known, the question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives has become a challenging issue for both patient doctor.In I feel a strong urge to support the obligation to inform the patient 's relatives .
As genetic risk, patient next-of-skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk,hence the need to inform their relatives is important and necessary preventative measures can be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur.For example,if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic disease genetic traits might be passed on to the next generation if you have a child, by letting your family members aware of the situation,it would lessen family stresses and suffering from forcing you to settle down and have children.However , social ethics issues like discrimination and privacy are major concerns and potential barriers to force patients and doctors to disclose information patients relatives.It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently , under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPAA ) in the United States,there is no legal obligation required to disclose information to relatives,it is up to the patient to disclose their family members.Early disclosement family members brings a positive reaction and prevention,as in the case of Angelina Jolie,she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to five percent.I still recall her for giving her story was that she does not want to live under the shadow of cancer .
However,there are still people who are against the decision of revealing private information.As for Alzheimer patients, the patient 's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors tried to interpret ,how will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimize potential negative impact on family members ( DementiaToday 2012 ) 2004 are associations providing help to Alzheimer patients Alzheimer 's Association ( Alzheimer 's Association,1980 ) .Although there are thousands of genetic risk of disease out there that might not be receiving all the help and support from everyone to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is the best help that patients need in difficult times .
In conclusion,the state should have a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors and to what extent should a doctor choose to reveal to family members about the genetic disease in which situations it allows patients decision.In addition,the state could also encourage to create assistance schemes to help help needy patients to encourage them to open up for the benefit of family members.Although may face challenges from social ethical issues,in the long term,with appropriate encouragement and help from the government, individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measures to protect their health and their loved ones .
Nowadays , the genetic field has been further and further since high-velocity technological advancement .
Not long ago , the human genome project sponsored by several large multinational corporations ( MNCs ) .
In comparison , in the field of genetic testing , which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder , as the technology has matured , an even more popular topic arises .
While most people agree that everyone has the right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test , the difference is whether it is the patient 's responsibility and freedom to share the result with his or her relatives .
In my opinion , the patients who are carriers of known genetic risk to share the truth with their family members .
Admittedly , it is a social obligation to be responsible for .
In society , it is a duty .
Take H1N1 as an example , people in Singapore , including students , travelers at the Changi Airport , workers in the office as well as passengers on the street are forced by law to take their temperature and report the results to the relevant government authority in charge .
The family members , it is also a moral obligation .
How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and their loved ones in danger ?
The family i s that trust and love each other with no doubt .
Without trust and love , there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together .
Hence , it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of genetic disorder , both as a social responsibility and help to protect the family .
Moreover , telling their family members is the fastest and easiest way to get their support .
Without the support of loved ones , patients ' life is better than death .
Family members , the closest group of people who get comfort is a crucial factor to successfully overcome any troubles as a result of genetic disorder .
A study of New York University in 2010 shows that patients with family members with generally gets 2-4 days faster than those taken by professional nurses .
Even for patients with terminal diseases , the duration of survival is 30 % longer due to family support .
Some people may say that telling the truth may create unnecessary fear and panic which will endanger the family harmony .
While every family needs to have that kind of troublesome situations , troubles that a family has gone through , the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust , love and understanding .
Hence , in which everyone is truly believe in each other and love each other ,all these troubles are the testaments to make them stronger .
The lyrics of Kelly Clarkson , what does not kill you makes you stronger .
In Asian society where genetic testing is not a common practice , I think that it is the choice of the person whether he or she wants to tell his relatives about his or her disease .
The courage to genetic testing and to inform their relatives about the risks that may result in people being judgmental , it is risky and not confirmed .
Furthermore , it is the gene that is affected has the right to determine who they want to share the information .
Nevertheless , I feel that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk , I would like to suggest the person to share the information with their potential partner ( husband or wife ) , the individual 's genetic risk may affect their future .
Many people in our society are not well informed about genetic diseases and will most likely to judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases from the patients are abnormal or 'weird .
This is because related to genetic diseases such as Bubble-Boy disease autism or down-syndrome .
Those people , who are affected will have different physical characteristics compared to those with genetic diseases .
We know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations , many people still do it with or without realizing it .
In this particular case , we are discussing whether a person should tell his relatives about the RISK of a particular genetic disease .
It is normal for people to ask for a fair and similar treatment and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep their secrets or personal issues in case people judge them or treating them differently.Many people really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they just ignore the word 'risk and assume that the person has suffered from the disease .
To prevent that from happening , I feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share with his family as his family may be paranoid or think and act differently .
Especially when it is a risk , the choice is his because he is not an actual sufferer .
There may be some people who say that it is necessary to tell the family members about the risk , some of them may be affected , but I think this view point , you can trust your family regarding this issue may be .
May be we can trust our immediate family members , but can we trust the other relatives ?
Furthermore , the genetic risk of genetic disease is very personal , it is up to the person to tell their relatives about it .
However , as I said earlier , it is better for people to talk about the potential risk to his or her future partner for the genetic risk may affect their children .
This needs to be acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children .
It may be possible that both the husband and wife are carriers and therefore they should not have children because children may not be able to survive even after they are born .
In less extreme cases , the child may be disabled .
This information plays a role in family planning matters , although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk , they should be encouraged to tell their partner .
In conclusion , the carrier wants to tell his relatives about his genetic risk , the choice is because the family has the right of it .
He may have a different opinion than the judges or for his family worried for thinking whether he should tell his relatives , no matter what choice he makes , we need to respect it and we have no right to say that he had to tell his relatives about it .
We all know that life is priceless and we have no right to judge a person 's death .
With the improvement of technology , new with genetic risk can be detected .
Genetic refers to the chance of inheriting a disorder or disease .
Therefore an entirely new dilemma is born : should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives ?
This essay will discuss the reasons why the relatives are obligated to be informed that their children have a genetic risk .
One of the reasons that parents should be informed that they have to decide whether they are able to raise a child with genetic risk .
The child with genetic risk may not have the ability to work , to build a family and most of the time they are not acceptable for the majority .
They may not be able to enjoy a normal person .
This competitive world is cruel to those who are not able to survive .
Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to support their children if they are not able to care for themselves .
The situation may become worse if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease , which means that parents have a heavy baggage , medical fees .
Not only children but also the entire family will suffer .
It is still too early for them to decide whether they can bring a new life to work and may suffer the pain of life .
The other reason is that parents should know the baby has a carrier of genetic risk for a nation .
There are newspaper reports that a newborn ba by has been abandoned at the hospital after they realized the baby has a disease that requires a huge amount of money to save .
In countries like Singapore , they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation .
However , every year , the government has to spend a lot to help the disabled , such as medical subsidizes and build up a special school to educate them .
With the increasing number of disabled in the nation , the government is able to concentrate on developing o ther military and education .
As citizens of a nation , they have the responsibility to support their country .
Moreover , in the world we live in today , many miscarriages conducted in the hospital .
It is easier for people to accept it morally .
I believe parents have the right to know the health of their children .
Many people support the idea that all people have the right to enjoy , especially with religion .
However , the problem is , people enjoy their life , they have to stay in hospital and with the needles and endless pain ?
Parents know what is best for their children , they will make a decision to be informed .
Also , people should improve the medical field in order to prevent the tragedy .
I think a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Genetic testing is a personal choice .
One should have full control of his/her and his /her right to decide whether or not to disclose it to someone else . 
As far as I am concerned , when a couple is going to have babies , they are going to run a few tests and see whether they have a genetic disease .
The results are disclosed to husbands and wifes .
This is not the case I am talking about here .
The most obvious reason for those who argue that the relatives of the carrier are at high risk of carrying the disease .
They have the right to know whether they are at risk .
Also , telling the result makes them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing .
They can take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease .
If a person has a disease And that might be a result of genes .
He runs a test and a gene STRAIT A .
This means both of his parents have children As they are at high risk of disease C. They could save the cost of running two separate tests to see whether they are at high risk of disease C. If he runs and know that he has the gene Aa .
This means one of his parents has the gene A and the cost of testing could be saved .
His relatives can take measures , this disease can somehow be p revented , to stop this disease from their lives .
This can be achieved by personal choice .
One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk .
Most people care about their relatives , there is no serious consequence of telling them so , I assume most of them tell their relatives to be careful .
One might also choose to show or encourage their certain relatives to run a genetic test if they are concerned about the negative consequences that comes across when they disclose their genetic results .
There are possible negative consequences that they might face if they disclose their genetic results to their relatives .
If a person is obliged to tell his relatives will be discriminated by those who do not carry this gene .
He or she might be advised to get married or have children .
For example , if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene as is sufficient for a very seriou disease .
After he took the test and was obliged to tell his relatives , know that he is a carrier .
So married couples run a test and not carriers.They might subconsciously see different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well .
Third , it is hard to define relatives .
If a gene runs in the family , family tested positive , he needs to tell .
If a big family , he had to tell everyone ?
They have very close relationships , A told his family that he has the gene , his uncle C knows and tells his wife . he needed to take his cousin has this disease .
However my wife Would not even the risk of having this disease .
Then she Will tell her mother , who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre .
In less than a half of the town knows A has a risk gene , and his family might be a genetic risk .
Nobody wants to marry and his relatives .
This is likely because if one does not have the control of information , especially when the party is obliged to disclose information to a potentially large group ( relatives ) .
In conclusion , a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
A Carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives .
Nowadays , people pursue the comfort of their own life , but also the development of their following generations .
The technology of modern society advances , it becomes possible for people to make a decision to take a genetic test to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risks that can affect the next generation .
The debatable question , an ethical dilemma , are responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk ?
In my opinion , the responsibility of telling my family and relatives is quite obvious .
There are two main reasons .
The first one is the importance of being responsible for your self-wellness and the health of your relatives and the second one is responsible for the next generation .
The awareness of your relatives and families about genetic risk is your self-wellness and the health of your relatives .
If you are carrying the genetic risk , there is a possibility that your relatives , parents or siblings are carrying the same genetic risk .
The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger .
If you have n't undergone genetic testing , odd and fate for what will happen to you and your relatives .
However , if you have undergone and know that you are a carrier , you are responsible for your whole family .
Even if you can not eliminate the risk completely , you can at least try to be alert to avoid getting the disease .
As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected , they can go to the hospital to check .
Therefore , telling the family and relatives to be prepared to fight the disease and even prevent the disease is your responsibility .
Furthermore , you are also responsible for the next generations by telling the truth that you are a carrier of a genetic risk .
If your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby , it will be possible for your child to have the same genetic risk .
As a parent , you are responsible for the next generation , allow the genetic risk to be passed on from generation to generation and being aware of it .
However , if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives , offer a chance to have a child .
If you decide to have a baby , the technology has developed , it is possible that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used , you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future .
It is the responsibility of being a parent .
In my opinion , this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing the genetic testing .
In conclusion , once you have undergone genetic testing and being aware of carrying specific genetic risk , responsibilities to your relatives , and following generations by telling your relatives and families .
To tell or not for
Consider , we decided to undergo genetic testing to know the result .
We found that we are the genetic risk carrier .
Then it becomes troublesome if we need to tell our relatives who carry genetic risk .
There are a lot of things we need to consider .
Every choice we make will have a huge impact on their life .
As a result , what should we do ?
Tell them or keep it a secret until we die ?
Many people feel that we should tell our relatives that we really care about their health status .
For example , diabetes is a genetic disease .
Once we found we were carrying this genetic risk , it is better to tell our family members because they may carry .
If we tell them , they may start paying more attention to their daily habits like eating less sugar with food and keep a good mood .
It is important for young people .
The earlier we talk , the habit will be better for the rest of their lives .
They may undergo genetic testing to see whether they are carrying it also better .
However , some people may argue that we want to interfere with their lives ?
Sometimes it becomes extremely hard for them to accept this , especially if they know that they or their children may have a severe disease like blood disease is untreatable .
Imagine you are living like a normal person , but one day your relatives will tell you that it is possible that you may encounter some problem , what kind of feeling are you going ?
It may affect our daily lives and we think about it every day .
We become so anxious that we ca n't focus on everything .
At the same time , there will also be a chance that the genetic test result is not correct , which means they are wasting their lives worrying about it , so we are bringing them .
Personally I feel that we should take responsibility for the situation .
This will affect their lives , we should try to make it in a positive way .
We ca n't let it go .
We should know that although we may affect their lives , we can still make correct choices in the future .
It is only after we tell them to start paying attention to their health .
They will consider whether to give birth to a baby with a genetic problem and find ways to avoid their baby to carry genetic risk .
They always have a choice about whether to undergo genetic testing .
Maybe when we tell them , they will go for it and know more about themselves .
I know it will have a huge impact on them , but we know that our loved ones , we need to tell them and help them .
A genetic risk carrier should be obliged for
Genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk of disease .
Once the test is done , whether the results should be open to his or her relatives has caused social extensive controversy .
Some say it is an invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be protected .
They have the right not to tell anyone .
However , in my opinion , it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell their relatives about their situation .
This essay will illustrate two aspects .
First of all , it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible problems that they may have .
As we all know , genetic risk carriers are likely to pass the genes to their family members .
When a person is found to be carrying risky genetic , other members in the family may also have the risk of disease .
Some diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old .
Therefore , telling relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble and save time for proper treatment .
Sometimes life may be saved if they are told and conduct timely treatment .
So for the love of the other family members and relatives should be informed .
Secondly , they can avoid genetic disease passed on to the next generation as they intend to have babies .
They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage .
They need to ask a doctor 's advice before they have a baby .
Genetics gene will pass to boys rather than girls , however .
If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse , another life may be at risk of inheriting the genetic disease .
I noticed a story in the newspaper years ago .
A couple in China have a son of 5 years old .
Their son unfortunately fell ill and he was diagnosed with a genetic disease that is very serious .
They were told that the wife 's family was carrying polygenetic disorder and only boys rather than girls .
Therefore their son inherited a genetic disease .
However , the wife had already known the polygenetic disorder before marriage and she did not tell her husband .
He died after one year of treatment and the couple got divorced after that .
If the wife had found the truth and asked for a doctor 's advice before they have a baby , the tragedy would not happen .
In a nutshell , a carrier of a known genetic risk has the responsibility to tell his or her relatives .
On the one hand , it can tell members of the carrier 's family , the disease may have to be treated in time .
On the other hand , it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth .
Nowadays , with the advancement of technology , it is easy to do genetic testing .
We can not deny that the genetic testing to help people when they are faced with the disorder .
However , genetic information is a person 's privacy should be protected by law .
Therefore , a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
There are three reasons .
Firstly , the information concerning the genetic are personally is also a private people 's bank card key .
People should not be told without the person 's permission , even his or her family or relatives .
The government should use the law to protect the privacy .
Once genetic information is reported .
They know their potential disabled disease or other bad things .
They may have a tendency for even abandon her .
People do not have the ability to choose their children , they should not be considered badly because of bad genes .
I think whatever genetic or whether the gene is match with their parents should not be told to anyone even his or her family or relatives .
Secondly , the carrier of a known genetic risk may destroy the peace of family . the relationship between children and adults .
His family and relatives know that the person does not have a relationship with them .
However , they were very happy , but there are some barriers , which actually destroys the family .
The relationship between parents and their children should be tested for genetic ; it is much deeper and tighter .
They give knowledge to children , but they feel happy with children .
Children rely on their parents .
When they grow up , they take care of their parents and thank them for their dedication .
The relationship between parents and children is love and dedication .
Nobody wants to see a broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk .
Therefore , a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without their permission .
Finally , the technology of testing gene is very mature .
There is also the possibility of wrong testing .
If the testing was found by the doctor , the family and the children may be sad and struggling for their life .
I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives .
Therefore , considering people 's privacy and the existence of wrong testing for the peace of the family , I believe that a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without their permission .
A Carrier of a Known Genetic Risk Should be Obligated to Tell His or Her Relatives .
More and more diseases are discovered to be related to genes with the development of medical technology .
People will know if they carry the disease on their genes after a genetic test .
If there is no problem , that would be wonderful .
However , not everyone is so lucky that they can make sure they do not carry any disease genes .
Therefore , once they carry the disease genes , they should be responsible to tell their relatives , their family members .
It may be awkward and embarrassing for people to tell the relatives that he or she is a carrier of a known genetic risk .
But one and the same forefather , then they have the same genes in some parts .
Therefore there is nothing to be shy or afraid of .
If they tell their relatives that he carries a disease gene , his or her relatives can go to hospital to see if they get a disease gene .
Then the relatives can prepare themselves to prevent the disease to occur .
They can prevent the disease to their offspring .
If the relatives carry the disease gene , they can share with and help , they will teach them how to communicate with others about this issue .
If he or she is not married , he or she must tell her partner that he carries the disease gene .
Then they can have a healthy baby with the help of doctors .
Or , if he has the genetic risk , they may have a healthy baby and may cause the death of the baby at the end of their marriage .
There is a story I watched on TV .
A couple did not have children after marriage , their parents were anxious about that and asked them to go to the hospital to see what the problem was .
After I came back from the hospital , the man told his parents that he carried the disease gene so that they can have a baby in their life .
The woman did not know the result , but she overheard the conversation and decided to divorce her husband .
After the divorce certificate , showed the report , wrote that the woman was carrying the disease gene instead .
At that time , the woman knew how much her husband loved her but she ruined her happiness .
Tears showed nothing .
People can avoid carrying the disease genes , born .
However , they can avoid the disease genes being inhered to their children .
By telling their relatives that they have a risk of carrying the disease gene can make their family bonds , many risks and conflicts can be avoided .
Genetic testing has become a beneficial way to predict and protect individuals at risk for a disorder .
However , there is a family-related ethical dilemma it is a carrier 's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known .
I am inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the right to know the result .
The answer is that everyone in our family has the right to know the truth .
It is said that the genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results , the potential negative impacts of the risks still exist , the result will be significant if other members of your family do not know .
They are unable to have a right to protect themselves and emotional preparations .
Taking , Angeline Jolie , she is famous but she revealed the truth about genetic testing on the development of breast cancer risk .
It is not that bad if you know how to look at the bright side with hope .
People may feel angry , depressed , or guilty about their results .
In some cases , the carrier can get tension within a family because the result is also related to other risks . 
However , I believe it is a common reaction to this situation .
In addition , it can be possible in some cases , the family can the discrimination in employment and social life , people can have more dramatic tragedies such as sickness or death if they can not overcome this harsh situation .
Life is hard , but I ca n't blame it on being unfair .
It is not strong enough to overcome the hard times .
Furthermore , a secret is not a good feeling , especially if the situations of relatives become worse , you should feel guilty and depressed .
Moreover , the truth can not be hidden forever , but when it is revealed , shocking and upsetting .
As a result , the interests of the families and their relatives , or the genetic testing results .
Last but not least , genetic testing is a personal matter , telling the result to your family can improve and develop understanding and sympathy for each other as well as promoting awareness of taking care of everyone 's health .
That plays an important role in the possibility that relatives can overcome the discrimination of the society and worry about the risks .
To put it in a nutshell , I believe that people should have the opportunity to tell their relatives about the genetic testing results for the good of their health .
It can be very difficult but necessary for the carriers and their families .
In addition , emotional preparations and the way you explain your genetic condition is important so that you can convey the information to your family and relatives and to guide them if they wish to conduct a similar genetic testing .
The Impact Of Social Media
Social media has played a vital role in our lives .
It is almost impossible to keep away from it .
I invoving into Facebook a few years ago,when I had just arrived in singapore .
I have over 500 friends on Facebook and buried myself hundrends of seeds .
We know each others ' status changes through social media .
For example , if we change our contact numbers , we send SMS to each individual .
We will post a seed and tagging our friends about this changments .
If you are not , you will lose .
In some aspects , social media has brought us a lot of convenience .
It is more convenient than talking through the phone since it is free .
We discuss every thing we have more personal space.Our friends got access to know what we are doing and what we like .
Also , we get a chance to talk to people like popular stars and their lives .
In China , government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people , like firefighters , police stations and so on .
Socia media allows them to inform people what is going on .
And lots of rescue jobs are done with the help of social media , like to get lost .
More convenient and humanian communications , the relationship between the government and the people are largely improved .
What 's more , various cultures can be shown through social media .
We can learn more information and cultures through socia media .
The scope of social media has made our way .
However , we get less and less important to talk face to face on social media is convenient , advanced and interesting .
And we gather more people find less topics to talk and choose to divide their social media .
When we are , social media makes in front of each other ; when we have each other , we seem to be further than .
This feeling makes people 's relationships as stable , safe and reliable .
Besides , people shwing pictures of yummy food and travelling .
To some extent , this makes our life more luxry and blundering .
I have been to some places I saw those beautiful pictures taken by firneds .
Sometimes I even canoot sleep because of excitement .
Social media makes our life pattern quickly and left us less time to think about our life .
Social media is becoming more important and we need to consider to serve .
Interpersonal skills , like any other skill requires practice .
Besides that , the skills required to develop and adapt .
The burgeoning of social media has its stint ; but amongst all the good things , in moderation .
Convenience and efficiency are two very important uses of social media .
While millions of users are connected at any one time , the information is readily available on the check .
This improves the connectivity between users .
For example , to send notifications and other information we use in hardcopy in the web and the process takes seconds .
The receipent,will receive information almost immediately depending on the quality of the network .
This convenience can be perceived as in realtime .
Next , communication skills are greatly improved .
In the past , a communication is done by one of the telegram , snail mail and poor-quality voice calls .
With the welcoming of applications such as Skype and Facetime , any individual can phase out , the olden days communication methods .
Aside from the voice , a webcam could also be affixed to emulate a real interactions with expressions and gestures .
Communication has taken a different turn without easily available social media .
However , it is a good practice to intensely social media .
Close interaction greatly lack in social media interactions , particularly .
To meet and interact with things allows one to be closer to the recepient .
It involves a dynamic interaction which utlises the motor , and verbal cortex of the coordinate .
Unlike the use of social media , interactions with thinking and typing .
As a result , one does not train the necessary parts of the skills required for a good interpersonal relationship .
It is entirely incorrect to mistake social media for the lack of interpersonal skills .
Howard Garner studied the effect of multiple intelligences among people and stated that interpersonal intelligence is a skill on its own - , some do not .
Howard Garner mentioned that the intelligence can be charted according to utilising tests and ranked .
Fundamentally , those who scored lower ranking for interpersonal skills are more likely to stumble when it is needed .
Though social media is not necessarily bad , it must be used accordingly for work , family , friends .
The types of must also take note - informing , interacting , discussing and others .
The amount of separation between the parties must be looked at .
For people who live far away from one another , the intensive use of social media is justified .
For those who live within the community should at least , and use social media as a primary source of communcation .
And at the same time , improve the interpersonal skills , dynamic practices between individuals and realtime .
The inclusion of intimate presence and relative touch could bring a better ratio between the interacting .
Recently , the rise of social media has helped people to have a closer connection with each other , it is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact as face to face meetings .
In my opinion , social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance to have face to face contact and thus negatively affect interpersonal skills .
On the other hand , it may increase the chance of having face to face contact among people .
First , social media networks have a user base , it helps to link people from different parts of the world .
In the social networks , people may not have the chance to meet others from different countries or the ones they have never met before .
The number of people know only limited to the people they meet in life as classmates and friends .
Therefore , social networks bring more connections between people and have a chance to chat with people they never met before , and it helps to develop interpersonal skills .
Secondly , social networking takes time for people to chat online , but , they may decide a online to meet others face to face .
In this case , the social network helps to increase the frequency .
For example , if a social network does not exist , the need to meet each other face to face and it is time-consuming , even with that , it still takes a lot of time traveling is a waste .
However , social networking helps people to meet and chat easier , they can even use video chat and create a group chat to chat with multiple parties at the same time .
Nowadays , some companies conduct online video interview applicants as it saves time and money .
Social networks may also have some negative impacts .
The largest negative impact is that the online network , people start to rely on the internet every minute .
They spend too much time using online social network and to have a daily meeting with people in real life .
It not only affects the interpersonal skills but also bad for people 's health if they spend too much time on social media .
Secondly , social networks may give their personal information to the public , as the cyber environment is not perfectly safe , people can protect their privacy online effectively and sometimes people may use their personal information to deceive .
In conclusion , the unsafe online environment , spend too much time on the internet may be potential negative factors of using online social networks .
It provides people with more convenient to connect the environment and improve the frequency of meeting .
It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chat .
Overall , there are more benefits than costs .
The world is increasingly becoming flat with all kinds of social networking websites such as facebook and twitter .
We can know a friend who live thousands of miles away for lunch though social media .
From some points of view , society has a lot of advantages to let us communicate with cheaper and more conveniently .
However , the disadvantages can not be ingnored when you consider it as a platform to show off the stage for cyber crime .
Social network sites provide us convenience .
Without hanging out with friends or talking with friends on the phone , we can know her latest news by scanning the webpage .
It can help us learn more about each other .
It can make people closer .
For example , if you find your friend 's favourite singer is Justin Biber through facebook , you can give him or her Justin Biber 's new album or concert tickets as a birthday gift .
It will be really sweet and you will surely become closer .
In addition , social networking sites can help you keep in touch with friends that live far away .
I met some canadian friends in Egypt .
Without facebook , we lost contact .
However , thanks to facebook , I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they are doing as we live close to each other .
The disadvantages of social network media are undeniable .
Research shows that people will unconsciously hide their real thoughts when they say or write something that will be exposed to the public .
It means that one can know another 's thoughts and personalities by reading things that they put on social networks .
It will make them quite upset when they talk in real life .
In addition , the nice guys on social networking websites , one can observe people around him , communicating with friends on facebook .
It is common that two people sitting next to each other , seldom talk to each other , but look at their cellphone .
This kind of behaviour is not good for people 's psychological health according to research .
Cyber communication is different from face-to-face communication and depends on cyber communication so will not get used to the life .
In addition , cyber relationship can work in real life .
No relationship in real life , but close cyber friends are more likely to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings to bond with our five senses .
With the willingness of people to become the best among others , social networking sites have become a place to show off .
Some people post their expensive or overseas places of interest their social networks and get a feeling of satisfaction .
It is mentally unhealthy and may cause people , especially teenagers , to become .
Last but not least , personal information on social networking site , it is convenient for criminals to use this information to commit a crime .
Above all , social networking sites are two sided knife and take advantage of it by avoiding the disadvantages such as less personal information on their facebook page .
The modes of communication have changed over the years , from letter to social networking .
This phenomenon is caused by the rapidly changing technology has made communication to be faster than ever before .
Today , social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter , are relatively common in contemporary society , and people can communicate with each other , online or offline , these social networking platforms .
They can make new friends with similar interests on these platforms , which will be able to connect to anyone in many parts of the world .
However , critics may argue that the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people prefer sitting in front of a computer and going out and meeting new friends .
This essay will discuss the benefits and advantages of using social media in contemporary society .
Nowadays , social media is able to disseminate information faster than any other media .
There are about 50 % of the people who have learned about breaking news from social media .
This is due to spending comparatively more time on social networking sites than reading newspapers .
Furthermore , with the current technology , smartphones are able to access social media sites which have made it easier for consumers to use .
Hence , social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information about what the people around them .
However , critics may argue that information or news disseminated are reliable .
There might be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media .
For example , in 2012 , there were false rumors of fires , shootouts , and caravans of gunmen in Mexico City suburb had spread through Twitter and Facebook .
This caused panic among the people who have flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls , and this was temporarily closed schools .
The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat , given that social media can disseminate information in a relatively fast .
Nevertheless , the cyber police who roam these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around .
But , there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites , despite high security to control every social networking .
Social media can improve relationships and make new friends , if there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties .
Many teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media , regardless of their location .
In the past , people used to write letters to their friends and it will take a long time to send the letter .
Therefore , with the help of technology , people are able to catch up with each other effectively .
Furthermore , it will be easier to make new friends and find people who have similar interests and hobbies .
However , in order to maintain their relationship , as well as making new friends , mutual trust and understanding between both parties .
It might not be accurate to judge the other party 's feelings on social media as one can cover up their emotions on social media .
In addition , there are also chances to miscommunicate with each other as they can sense the tone of the other party on social media platforms .
This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over a misunderstanding .
But , if there is trust and mutual understanding on social media , it would be ideal for people to improve their relationships and make new friends .
In conclusion , social media in contemporary society is able to help improve relationships and make new friends , disseminate information efficiently to the masses .
However , there are risks of false information and the chances of miscommunication .
Nevertheless , the advantages of social media will benefit the masses of the negative aspects can be carefully taken care of .
All-in-all , social media is the product of rapid technological advancement and more .
Advantages : Social media sites have greatly ease long distance communication and interaction due to its accessibility and convenience .
With a globalized and interconnected world , Twitter and Facebook are the main platform for social interaction .
With just a touch from any media and electronic devices can easily interact and communicate with friends without a hassle .
Thus , a long distance relationship or friendship can be maintained and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier .
The sharing of personal photos , posting the status of personal feelings and able to reply to these posts allowed human interaction to engage and expand with ease .
Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words on social media platforms .
Thus socialisation can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisation of social media platforms.Meet-ups and we are no longer a barrier for people to interact and communicate with one another , human interaction at one 's own convenience .
Society will adapt to such phenomena as physical interaction are transformed into cyber interaction .
With the frequent usage and reliance on social media and Internet society socialises the computer will be more advanced and adapted to the highly connected world .
This will help the society to progress rapidly .
Disadvantages : One of the main concerns of using social media platforms to communicate credibility .
The certainty of what is shared and expressed could be proven physically media limits the physical interaction , using a webcam to chat .
We ca n't be certain about the reliability and truth of posts or information we received through Inetrnet .
We may in actual fact communicating with a fake Facebook account of the internet , which we assume to be true , but in reality it is a fake .
Photos and information retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit a personal agenda .
Thus , the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts the actual interaction can be stimulated through the media .
Although emocons can be used to show certain emotions , which differs from the authentic emotion of your friends when you observe them through their body language and facial expressions .
The danger of media socialisation is the uncertainty of communication due to the lack of physical interaction .
Furthermore , the lack of physical interaction has affected human inter-personal behaviour and communication is made through social media instead of an alternative .
This lowers the ability to interact with one another , which adversely shapes one 's behaviour .
The lack of exposure to real life interaction with people with develop the confidence and skills needed to interact seamlessly and effectively with others .
Therefore , effective and efficient , there is a need to have a balance of social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction with people .
Nowadays , people can use their phone to read the news and the first clue of what is happening in the world .
People use Twitter to follow the artists or celebrities love and Facebook to see their friends ' recent activity .
Nevertheless , they still use the phone to make a call and message contacts .
The phone did the job , but devices like computer , laptop , tablet , and other devices which are able to connect to the internet .
It is obvious that the internet helps people and also connect people globally .
Several arguments have been made regarding social media is actually an inevitable disadvantage .
People can use electrical devices to access the internet .
Whenever they need to use social media , they have to use a phone or the internet .
Generally people need their eyes to look at the display screen of the phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device .
As a result , they will lose the eye contact and hands to express their feelings to the people around them , they have lost the tools people need face-to-face contact with .
This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes .
A family having dinner in a restaurant talking because holding and looking at the display screen with one hand while the other hand is holding a fork .
A group of friends having high tea in caf é without chatting , because they do not know what to talk about , but pressing on the display screen .
Children do not know the neighbourhood games and staying with them , all they know is pressing icons on the screens .
These are some concrete examples of how socia media reduce face-to-face human contact .
When people get used to using socia media to communicate , what their interpersonal communication skills will degrade lost .
Firstly , they have the courage to meet strangers , courage .
Also , they will not have enough experience to communicate with people and be trained in their conversation .
As a result , social media helps them do the jobs but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills .
Social media has some advantages with their general benefits .
First of all , people can save money by using the internet to meet other people and reading the news .
A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in another country via socia media software instead of making an international call costs normally paid .
He can talk to her daughter face-to-face video call via the internet .
Secondly , people make friends all over the world and be able to update their friends about his recent activity .
A guy who is traveling for months can tell all of his friends about his activity .
When one of his friends who are not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls , he might be able to get his do n't know whereabouts using social media .
These are the advantages that save works .
In conclusion , socia media benefits people in several ways but harms .
People should avoid misuse of socia media and use it properly .
With the aid of social media , the bonds globally , information flows rapidly , and human lives .
All of us are living in the technology field .
Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect us with other people ?
It started withthe invention of technology has evolved significantly over the past few decades .
In the past , traveling by ship and the airplane .
In the past , it took a few days to receive a message we need to send a letter , we can use email , which stands for electronic message to send messages to our friends or even use our cellphone to send our messages .
From the example that I mentioned earlier , we can see that the distance between us and our loved ones are getting further apart .
This is because the ease of technology such as the airplane , some of our friends will be going overseas to continue their studies or even if you are away from your family to pursue your studies and career .
Thus , Twitter and Facebook become one of the medium that we need .
Nevertheless,everything has positive and negative effects .
This is applicable to these social media sites .
The next two paragraphs will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society .
With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep up to date with our family and friends , even though we are away from them .
Social media sites such as Facebook have allowed us to share our pictures and chat online with our parents while we are overseas .
This approach helps parents to communicate with their children and know what kind of activities their children are overseas .
Social media is beneficial as it connects you and your loved one even though you are separated by distance .
It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family , but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family .
As I mentioned in the beginning , there are also disadvantages of social media tools .
One of them is to reduce the level of concentration , especially among youngsters .
This is because it is part of the habit of checking their facebook page as their friends post something new every second .
Thus , students will browse websites while attending lectures .
This means that the students are not concetrating when they are supposed to .
As a result , it could affect their lives .
This will then lead to stress as students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted .
In my opinion , every individual has to take responsibility for their own lives by making the right decision .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using social media sites , however in this case , striking a balance between social media and the most important thing to do .
Nowadays , the sociall media platforms are commonplace in our lives .
In the increasingly globalised world , these platforms even enhances and compliccates links between indivduals .
Thanks to them , people can get to know one another online , without having to travel to meet up for business purposes for business or personal reasons .
However , it is also bringing social changes as such virtual worlds are overtaking the natural world , resulting in negative impacts in individuaul daily lives and become a problem in society as a whole .
As people spend more time on social media sites , the importance of face-to-face human contact has decreased .
People feel more confident online that they do not have to face real-life there , they feel more comfortable and prefer communicating online .
This results in a lack of interpersonal skills in individual , young students as they always have to turn back to real life and online .
This is a huge problem when they have to face in real life .
They are so used to having an online avatar , they may lose their self-identity in real life and may not understand how to interact with people in real life .
Another problem with social media is that the benefits of investing in such an enormous amount of time and energy is relfected as something positive to the users .
The reason why it is so addictive is that people get into social media , they seek attention from their friends .
However , sparks of sudden attention is short-termed and went easily and does not add any value or meaning to the user .
Also , according to a research , it has been proven that users feel sad after using Facebook and because users already compare their lives with other people 's lives .
But , most people only send the happiest moments in their lives .
Social media has some strong benefits that users are the links between people .
Indeed , I use Facebook for my friends ' contacts that I want to keep .
However , the friendship in the virtual world is so superficial , which is not related to real life .
Also , many profit-driven companies realize the huge crowds on social media sites , a pond to fish customers by uploading many advertisements .
Furthermore , this may cause privacy issues as Facebook allows other profit-driven companies have access to the information of the users .
As this happens , users are more pron to frauds .
Social media sites are at their peaks , however , I believe that when people realize that such sites are making them in real-life , they will not be indulged in it now .
Users soon will realize that they do not need social media sites to keep in contact with their friends , if they need someone , they will reach them no matter what .
We are all connected through all sorts of social media , but do we really get connected or falling apart ?
Social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are born with the intention of connecting with people from around the world .
The idea is great , most people , even the older generation will have at least one social media platforms like Facebook .
They are the friends of their kids , and they can " follow " their kids and in real time .
People post their thoughts and daily activities on Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook , connecting with their so called friends .
However , we tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced in face-to-face human contact , that affects our interpersonal skills .
First and foremost , I would like to share the advantages of using social media .
As a student , I tend to meet lots of people from different backgrounds and different backgrounds .
We may meet only once we exchange contact numbers as well as a facebook account in order to keep in touch .
Unlike just contact numbers that we call social media like facebook is a great way for people from different fields and from different parts of the world to connect .
Within clicks , we could check on a friend 's profile and read his/her updates .
On the other hand , we can update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends could read up on the newsfeed .
This allows people who may not have the time to meet up to do .
Not only that , people can easily met through online platforms .
Hence , our social circle is expanding .
Nonetheless , it seems to connect the cause is us .
The obvious disadvantage of using social media is the reduction of face-to-face contact .
This eventually leads to the interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our social circle .
For example , we tend to send birthday wishes on Facebook promts " Today is someone 's birthday .
In fact , we may have forgotten our friend 's birthday .
We send wishes cards during the festive season like Chinese New Year , and we feel good to write and receive a stamp on it .
Gone are the times , and now the message and the receiver may feel in this online program .
As time passed , we may have more " friends " on the list , but the meaning of friendship needs to be redefined .
In a nutshell , every sword has two edges .
The users of the social media sites need to strike a balance between the real and the virtual .
To maximize the benefits of such platforms , but be careful of its impacts on the actual life .
Ultimately , the best way to improve interpersonal skills through face-to-face meetings , social media sites are tools to enhance it .
Nowadays , social media sites are commonly used in the society .
I believe 80 percent of people in social media sites .
These sites play the role of connecting people around the world .
It has the function of connecting , sharing , interacting and advertising .
However , there are also some disadvantages that occur due to social media are in the society .
This article is written to explain the pros and cons of using social media in our daily life .
First , the importance of social media sites that help people are able to interact and communicate with friends and family , or even strangers without time and space constraints .
Through the social media sites we can chat with our friends in Europe and New Zealand .
There are over thousand miles between Singapore and the two countries .
However , we are able to chat with our friends without travel .
It saves a lot of time and money , as well as strengthen our relationship , although we live in different places around the world .
Besides , the company can use the convenience of social media sites such as Facebook , chat or Skype to facilitate the meeting with people of around the world .
Substantial cost saving without tiring traveling from one point to another .
With the huge amount of cost savings and capital can be utilized in other sectors which benefits the company and boost the company 's profit .
However , there are two sides of the story .
Some scholars argue that the use of social media reduces the face-to-face humans .
Since ancient times , humans interact with others face to face .
Without the facial impression , it is easy to misunderstand the intentions of the speakers .
That is why your impression is one of the most important elements in society .
In addition , social media sites will affect writing skills , that is the point .
Based on the statistics reported , writing skills will be reduced when the time on social media sites .
I believe that most of us have experienced suddenly forget how to write that .
The automatic correction software is effective when using electronic devices until we realize the importance of writing .
Writing is an essential skill to express their feelings and opinions .
'Privacy ' is the word that is popular in the past few decades .
People have their own rights and privacy .
I believe that most of us agree with these terms .
However , the social media sites , leaking users ' information to companies with cash reimbursement .
Everything we type in social media sites is recorded in the server and then transfer to the companies for spying and advertising .
Although it looks like no laws and it is your own space to do anything you want , you are wrong .
You are not controlled by government laws and watched by the government .
In conclusion , everything has two sides .
It is our responsibility to identify the advantages and disadvantages of social media sites .
To utilize the technology , we should do our best to weigh the pros and cons but lengthen the pros and shorten the cons .
Thus , the new technology will bring a prosperous future for our next generation .
With the wide spread of advanced technology , social media sites are becoming more and more popular .
Getting connected on social media such as facebook and twitter has become a trend as well as work .
In this situation , both advantages and disadvantages of using social media to apply to our daily lives .
On one side , obvioualy many advantages have been brought to our lives .
Social media provides people with the opportunity to meet with each other every time and everywhere .
Whether we are at home or at school , at work or on holiday , we are able to communicate and interact with our friends .
Even when people are thousands of miles apart , social media makes it possible to have interaction by writing comments .
When our phones are , we can also use social media to get intouch with our friends .
Some people try to say can also actively take part in chatting via social media .
We can make more friends by interacting with our friends bring their friends .
Therefore , the popularity of social media sites has made it more convenient for people to update friends ' status and communicate with friends more frequently .
On the other hand , we need to think about the influences of social media .
There are many disadvantages of using social media .
Firstly , interpersonal skills may be affected by the reduction in face-to-face human contact .
While social media brings convenience to people , more and more people are willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face conversation with time and requirement .
People who are not good at public speaking may be reluctant to talk to people and interpersonal skills can improve this situation .
Secondly , over-addition may avoidably , to some degree , reduce social alienation , and that alienation causes social media users get the over-dependence of virtual social networking .
More networking has been transferred to the internet .
This is a potential danger for teenagers who grew up with social changes to get hurt .
Thirdly , updating of luxury living standard as well as for situations make people 's daily life more grandiloquent , accurate social growing trend .
Lastly , it is easy to waste a lot of time using social media .
Again , there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addition and their work may be greatly influenced .
We can see both the advantages and disadvantages of using social media , we can not deny the benefits that have been brought to us , the trend of using social media may be lasting for a long time .
Therefore , when we use social media , we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid being affected by the disadvantages .
By absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of social media .
The sophisticated era these days , experts have produced products that are meant to make life easier .
Geographical and transportation borders are a problem because communication and information technologies were enhanced .
It may be perceived as innovation created even when Graham Bell introduced .
However , the internet is known , the telephone started to give way to social media sites .
Many advantages to the users .
Let us take an example from Facebook and Twitter , two of the most popular social media sites .
Through Facebook , people are able to maintain relationships with their friends .
These benefits can be obtained through telephone or mail because people particularly address may change from time to time on Facebook , people can keep in contact with old friends with names and photos , as the identifier .
Facebook is like a combination of messages and chatting , personal profile , media sharing and entertainment add-on ( i.e. 
social games which allow users to communicate with remote people to write and express themselves .
Twitter has simplified functions as Facebook gives more beneficial if used as information sharing .
Twitter allows users to upload is limited to short sentences in order to spread the word , the highlighted messages are delivered .
For Facebook , a comprehensive way of sharing is offered in many photos and videos can be uploaded , notes can be published , documents and data can be shared on Facebook .
These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile applications for smartphones .
Despite the luxury that is offered by social media , there are harmful side effects which people may not realize it beforehand .
Research shows that face-to-face meetings frequently among people who are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing .
As a consequence , it affects their interpersonal skills .
People can think while typing and what they want to say , in face-to-face communication , every word that comes out of your mouth and may be arranged in the picture of your personality .
It requires practice and can be done completely through social media .
There is a situation where a family is having dinner in a restaurant , but everybody is busy with their own gadget , posting pictures on Facebook , updating status on Twitter or chatting with friends .
These social media serves to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries , but it does not mean that the people are neglected as the payoff .
This is related to the interpersonal skill that is mentioned , that can be used well if we have gadgets , facing .
Another disadvantage that affects people is by showing selected parts of our lives , we build a " false image " .
We tend to share our happy moments in the media .
Because of this , people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problem at all .
Other people are influenced by us and tend to do the same .
As a result , people think their low and may lead to depression and mental disorder .
It also reduces our sympathy .
This is a serious social problem that affects a lot of people .
As explained above , modern and sophisticated technology does not give advantages .
There are a lot of disadvantages that people may not realize .
It is up to the discretion and comprehension to decide where they want to take .
So , we should never forget to calculate the profit and loss of every decision we make .
Nowadays , the advancement of technology has improved the lives of many people .
In most countries , the emergence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter .
Many people think that social media sites have good communication between people , while others argue that there are several negative impacts on the society .
One of the advantages is made by the social media sites that can connect us more closely .
In the past decade , social media sites are not yet fully developed , people connect with others who live far away from the phone , or even a letter .
However , calling a person by using a phone and the letter requires cost and sendi ng a letter to a person who lives far away in the villages , takes a lot of time .
The appearance of social media sites has problems to be solved .
People connecting through social media sites can spend no money , and only a few seconds for the message to reach .
Therefore , the advantage of social media sites to save money and provide convenience .
Moreover , it also provides an alternative way to meet a perso n whom they have not seen for a very long time , the primary school and secondary school .
As we graduate from school , we will lose contact with our friends .
Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses , and we are not able to find them by phone or letter .
If the phone and letters are the only way to contact them , we would not be able to find them .
Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make the connection between us and our old friends .
Hence , the social media sites serves as a platform for communication .
Everything comes with benefits will also have their disadvantages .
On the other hand , social media sites bring negative impacts on people and society .
The advancement of social media sites makes people rely on them , they prefer using those sites to contact each other and talk to each other face to face .
Many people argue that this is the most serious problem caused by social media sites .
The usage of social media sites , indirectly caused the reduction in face-to-face human communication , which will in turn cause the loss of interpersonal skills .
As we all know , interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas .
The loss of interpersonal skills resulted in the inability for people to present their ideas .
As a result , they gradually lose the ability to compete with each other .
In conclusion , social media sites have both positive and negative consequences for society .
In this modern society , we should learn to distinguish between good and bad impacts brought by the advancement of technologies and to avoid the disadvantages and maximize the benefits of those sites .
With the advancement of technology in recent years , keeping in-touch and latest news has a tremendous demand .
Some famous examples are social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
With the increasing use of more than a billion users from all over the world , social media sites have demonstrated clearly its success in playing an important part of our life .
However , there are arguments that social media life brings a reduction in face-to-face human contact , which in turn affects interpersonal skills .
Let 's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
First and foremost , social media sites are free .
All users need is an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ACCOUNT to start their journey in social media .
Secondly , it helps people keep in-touch with one another .
Finding old friends on Facebook , for example , is easier than asking people in real life .
Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer .
Thirdly , social media sites to keep up to date on the latest news and updates from around the world , with a click on the refresh button .
Last but not least , social media sites linked together by allowing us to create our own groups , pages or sites to share our hobbies , interests in certain subjects .
Hence , it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global inter-connected .
However , social media sites have a second of negative impact on humans .
Undeniably , it becomes addicted to spend more time while socializing and interacting .
We spend most of our time on sites like Facebook , Twitter and affects our daily work productivity and performance .
In the corporate world , employers often use social media networks to prevent employees to work on their leisure than concentrating on their work .
Using text-messaging as an informal way of communicating on social media networks also has a negative impact on us .
The more time we spend on these sites , the less time we spend on face-to-face communication .
It lessens valuable interaction between human and time away from the computer screen or mobile phone .
In addition , there are also some false reports fake IDs occur on both social media sites that use fake ID to insult or harass someone like the Heather Chua occurred recently on Facebook .
These malicious comments go viral and creates a strong negative effect on the user , which might lead to unwilling attitude to interact with others in real life , the victim .
In conclusion , everything has a two-sided effect , depending on how we use it .
With the availability of technology , it is valid that people become more technology-savvy and they want to spend more time interacting with each other through social media sites , it does not mean that we should neglect face-to-face human interaction as it plays an important part in our lives .
As more and more social websites such as Twitter , Facebook and Weibo have become ubiquitous , seamless and imperative , people worry about young people having problems with face-to-face communication skills .
However , I believe that the benefits brought by these online chat rooms tremendously outweigh the repercussions .
Social media enables us to explore the world far away without paying expensive airplane tickets and helping a one-week holiday .
The convenience is beyond description .
A smart phone or a computer at school , at work or at home , we can easily make friends worldwide with 'click and get to know about their life through having conversations with them , reading their blogs , photos and status .
Compared to face-to-face interaction , online conversation is easier for strangers to open their mouth .
This information has been revealed on the website , it is also easier to find common topics to talk about .
People usually like to share boldly about their real feelings on their masks , being taken .
This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012 , 80 % of the information posted online is a person like 3 out of 10 times .
This shows that a facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a facebook account .
We are being who we are , we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world .
Although sometimes the genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful , prevalent use of vulgarity and harsh-meaning comments , we can minimize the repercussions through strict regulations of content online .
Another advantage of social media is aiding the spread of democracy .
People around the world can share their thoughts about their governments .
That eliminates the incomplete information about the disadvantages of remote rural regions where people are less aware of what is happening around them .
One example is the 2012 riots in Egypt and Zambia .
The idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptians in Zambia quickly through the use of social media .
However , as the government controls the media .
These social media are tools of the campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public .
For example , in the 2012 general election in Singapore , Dr Tan Chee Keong used facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public .
Though , social media is a fair and transparent online platform for employees to share ideas compared to other traditional media .
Intensive use of Social media can reduce the time people spend in face-to-face communication .
It is commonly seen in a food court or restaurant with a group of people sitting together around a table with each of them having a cell phone in their hands .
They are too busy with too many virtual friends and they ignore the feelings of their real-life friends .
In this case , I have to say that to err is human .
What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends by their side and help them to manage their time .
In conclusion , social media has more advantages than disadvantages to our daily lives .
What we can do is to cautiously manage our time online and manage our words online .

Social media sites ' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable .
Thanks to social media , the communication among people all over the world and can be done with ease .
Apart from the ease of communication despite the distance , many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trade can be done through social media .
Nevertheless , the advantages , disadvantages may appear such as the reduction in face-to-face human contact affects interpersonal skills , privacy issues , as well as frauds that can be done through social media .
Twitter , Facebook and Skype are social media sites which enables us to keep in touch with our friends and family in other cities or countries .
Through these sites we are able to talk to them about their activities and their friends , From the point of view , there is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives , despite the distance .
The sharing of information can be done quickly through social media , that is why nowadays many new publishers make their own social media account , Channel News Asia has a twitter account and will update its followers with headline news .
That shows how the news and information can be shared easily through social media .
Furthermore , many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media , information can reach them easily without the need to watch or listen to the news reports .
Due to the popularity of social media , many people start their business on these sites .
More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook , whether it is our friends who sell their products and professional brands to sell their products online , we can buy and talk them through those sites , which can be considered as an advantage for the buyers .
However , it is the same when we keep in touch with people easily compared to when we meet them personally ?
I think there is a difference and I believe many of us will agree .
When we write or communicate effectively , we can hide our through feelings and not ourselves because we do not want the other party to judge .
Other than that , the message of the party can be delivered properly to the other since the communication is done through written language and 'tone ' messages and received may be different . 
Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online and in real life can be very shy and outspoken .
This will lead to inter-personal skills as well as a problem of trust .
Nowadays we can tru st people we know from social media , we will never know whether they are real .
Some people fake their identities in media sites so that they can know more people and even cheat .
In addition , privacy issue has become more popular nowadays because people do not realize that they may actually share that they are not willing to share .
Therefore , social media sites are undoubtedly benefits , we should consider the drawbacks and use it wisely so that we can gain more of the benefits and disadvantages in the smallest way possible .
It is common that almost everyone in public transport is in the phone or wearing a pair of ear piece in this modern society .
Not only one , but many developed and developing countries have the same picture .

It also has many negative effects , such as the loss of face-to-face communication skills are important .
This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life .
One of the significant advantages of using popular social media sites to each other , even without contact .
In this fast paced and competitive world , people may not be able to keep in touch with others .
With the help of social media , people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny scenes and they can update the information of their friends .
I am studying oversea s , busy life keeps me away from contact with my old friend .
Using a social media site with my friends to help me know their status .
I can easily find a common topic when I meet them .
In Singapore , Malaysia across the sea .
Many of them are busy at work and leave their children .
A Manager at workis the same .
My Manager taught her how to use Facebook , upload video clips of her grandchild .
My Manager would not miss the moments of her daughter 's growth .
Social media sites are a very useful tool for people to start a new friendship or relationship .
People get connected or close to the same preferences .
It is easier for people to approach the other learning .
Students can exchange their experiences in study in different countries .
People are able to share the culture and beautiful photos online , so others can share the joy .
I believe that social media sites are useful tools to help people to know each other better .
However , social media is a double-sided sword , it also brings some negative effects on our daily life .
One of the disadvantages that many people are concerned that people lose interest in face-to-face communication .
Many people like to pretend themselves and lose confidence when they talk to each other .
Although not everyone is good at public relations without the existence of social media sites , we can not deny that it affects people in the ir interpersonal skills .
In conclusion , the shadow is when there is light .
We should take advantage of the creatures we create and try to avoid negative effects .

The use of social media has largely influenced our ways of communicating with one another .
Online friends are real friends and real life friends to communicate with one another online .
Social media has changed our ways of exchanging information and interpersonal relationships profoundly .
There are advantages and disadvantages to this .
Social media has reshaped the way of communication .
In real life , we communicate with one another as equal participants .
We share ideas , stories and forge friendships based on mutual respect .
However , communication on social media is largely based on broadcasting and listening .
When we use facebook and post pictures and statuses .
We are actively " present " fa ç ades of our lives in front of others .
We tend to post pictures with the best , saying that it is funny .
We show the facades of others .
The images we choose to present for consideration .
The audience is not specific , but everyone might know , or even the entire world .
There is an element of looking for attention rather than expressing one 's true opinion on social networks .
On the other hand , the viewers , the listeners .
They are just scrolling down pages of pages of pictures and statuses and see that they think it 's funny .
It is the broadcasters themselves , they care about the content .
This type of communication does not help forging interpersonal relationships .
In real life , establishing a friendship requires a well-rounded understanding with one another and caring for one another .
The latter requires face to face interaction where we can show our emotions .
One can not truly understand the only stalking his facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present .
One can not truly show their emotions by another texting some . signs .
Broadcasting and viewing models are not forging relationships .
However , it is good to share information .
On social media , everyone is a broadcaster and viewers .
My social network , I seldom read newspapers or news websites anymore , because I can easily read the status of my friends .
I am interested in politics , I follow some political newspapers and public figures .
I get for sales , clothes and cosmetics from my friends .
Some of my friends have horrible taste in clothes and posts them , I can use them .
Information available .
The most popular information gets circulated as I seldom miss it .
Social network plays a role in providing and filtering information .
This saves a lot of time reading newspapers and watching TV .
Personally , I feel more at ease on social media .
From the above two points , I think social media can forge more interest-based friendships .
With the help of social media , I become real friends with online forums who share the same interests .
I know some of my friends ' interest to find common so talking to one another is about life , friends , etc .
Communication does not focus on how we feel , or to each otherm , but whatever , the content .
In this case , interpersonal skills are important because our goal is not to impress people , but to get the information that we are interested in .
In conclusion , social media has reshaped interpersonal relationships from a more human-based friendship requires sharing and caring friends to an information-based friendship requires mutual interest .
There are advantages and disadvantages , however , whether it is good or bad , we are still not sure .
It is just different .
Advantages and disadvantages of using social media .
People living in the modern world can not live without social media sites like Twitter and Facebook .
Almost all students and young adults have a Facebook or Twitter account .
It is true that social media allows people to connect with each other more conveniently .
However , it seems that , especially for those sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on social media sites is really necessary .
An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around a table , but none of them were chatting with one another .
However , all of them were interested in posting pictures of this " cheerful " meeting on social media sites .
Therefore , it is necessary to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media .
Social media allows people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another .
People used to write letters and send cards to keep in touch with people who live far away .
It can take a few days or weeks to receive the messages .
Nowadays , people need to do is type in front of the computer in their own rooms .
And it only takes seconds to receive the message .
Distance is no longer a problem , which is convenient especially when instant chat .
However , when people become more and more addicted to convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to their normal interpersonal skills .
Social media provides a way of talking and chatting , which can never be considered as a way of communication .
When people talk on media sites , there is no eye contact , no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed by using combinations of punctuations .
For convenience , sentences are shortened to three or four words such as lol ( laugh a lot ) and " possible " ( which means as soon as possible .
People go to great lengths to make them shorter .
While they are communicating with people , expressing themselves quickly became a big problem .
Social media provides people a bunch of information about people and their interests .
For example , on Twitter , it is exciting to follow that you adore like famous movie series stars , businessmen and ent repreneurs .
It makes people feel very close to their admirers ' lives .
Updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and laptops every time .
However , after one has registered in the social media sites which are not reliable , you have filled in a weapon against you .
Furthermore , people on social media sites are honest .
The profile picture may be that the user says he or she is .
The reason might be that he or she wants to decorate his or her face .
But there is a possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving in order to obtain your information against you .
No pledge of authenticity risks people and privacy are shared on social media sites .
To sum up , social media has advantages and disadvantages in daily life .
It shortens the distance between people from all over the world and instant communication .
And it becomes more convenient to obtain and update information by using social media .
On the other hand , social media makes people lose their ability to communicate effectively in their real lives and people risk exposing their privacy to those whose identity can be verified on social media sites .

With the development of technology , social media has become more and more important role in the world .
Everyone in the world can not stop using it every day to express their feelings and ideas , and a lot of other things that help their friends know their lives .

They feel it is difficult to find topics to communicate with other people .
Personally , I strongly agree that social media brings more disadvantages than advantages it gives us .
It is really useful when we need to let other people know that we live a good life , it takes a lot of time .
In another way , if we use the time we spend wandering on the internet , we may have already finished one or more meaningful things .
We should keep in mind that there are ways to communicate with our family and friends .
Everything will be bad if we do n't know how to use them wisely , whether it is good or not .
As a result , it is important to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on social media .

The long and time-consuming make spreading the message is very difficult .
Therefore , people can communicate with faraway friends and relatives unless there is something important .
However , people can connect with people all over the world who can use a computer , and there is no time delay of messages .

First and foremost , we should realize that social media is not trustworthy .
Everyone can make their personalities and characteristics .
They can become anyone .
Though social media can create relationships , relationships and friendships are strong and if people have experience and communication , face-to-face interaction .

She talked with them , trust them and share life with them .
Eventually , she discovered that eight people as they use eight different identities to chat with her .
